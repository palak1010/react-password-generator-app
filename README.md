# Password Generator App

This is a simple password generator application built with React. It allows users to generate random passwords based on their preferences such as the length of the password, the inclusion of numbers, and the inclusion of symbols.

## Functionality

- **Choose Length**: Users can select the length of the password they want to generate.
- **Number Allowed**: Users can choose whether numbers are allowed in the generated password.
- **Symbol Allowed**: Users can choose whether special character are allowed in the generated password.

## React Hooks Used

- **useState**: Used to manage the state of the application, including user preferences and the generated password.
- **useEffect**: Utilized for performing side effects like updating the password when user preferences change.
- **useCallback**: Used to memoize functions and prevent unnecessary re-renders.
- **useRef**: Used to create a reference to DOM elements or values that persist across renders.
